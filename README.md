# jcognos

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/CognosExt/jcognos.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Library that encapsulates the (undocumented) [IBM Cognos Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics) REST API.

You can use this to write tests, external clients or build tools for your Cognos environment. As the Cognos API is not official, things might break (badly) after Cognos upgrades.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install jcognos --save
```

Once the jcognos has been installed, you can include it in your projects as a CommonJS module

```javascript
require('jcognos');
```

or as an ES2016 module

```javascript
import getCognos from 'jcognos'
```
